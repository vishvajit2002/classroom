Global (Static) Variable: 
 Local variables are visible only within the declared method, constructor or block.
globalVar is static and shared across all instances of the class. It can be accessed without creating an object.

Instance Variable: 
 Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.
instanceVar is tied to an instance of the class, so it needs an object to be accessed.

Local Variable: 
localVar exists within the showVariables() method and can only be accessed inside that method.


note:-
the global or static variable and the instance variable can be acessed 
throughout the class, but local variable can only be accessed within its method.
