Great! Let's start with a few questions to help you prepare for your Java interview. I'll cover a mix of core concepts, coding, and practical scenarios.

### Core Java Questions:
1. **Explain the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java.**
2. **What is the difference between a constructor and a method in Java?**
3. **What is the purpose of the `final`, `finally`, and `finalize()` in Java?**
4. **How does the garbage collector work in Java?**
5. **Can you explain method overloading and method overriding?**
6. **What is the significance of the `static` keyword in Java?**
7. **What is the difference between `HashMap` and `TreeMap`?**
8. **What are checked and unchecked exceptions? Can you give an example of each?**
9. **Explain the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.**
10. **What is the `transient` keyword used for?**

### Coding Questions:
1. **Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome.**
2. **Given an array of integers, find the second largest number.**
3. **Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to 10 numbers.**
4. **How would you reverse a linked list in Java?**
5. **Implement a program to remove duplicates from an array without using a collection.**

### Practical Scenarios:
1. **How would you improve the performance of a Java application?**
2. **Describe the Singleton Design Pattern.**
3. **Explain how the `StringBuilder` is different from `String` in terms of performance.**
4. **How would you handle multiple exceptions in a try-catch block?**

Let's start with a few of these. You can answer them, and Iâ€™ll give feedback.
